## Steven Atoche - @Sterben2530

Hi, I'm Steven - a dedicated student enrolled in the Economics program at PUCP. As he eagerly anticipates entering the job market next year, he is determined to secure a rewarding position where he can contribute meaningfully and make a difference."

## My values :fire:

- Social Responsibility
- Resilience and Perseverance
- Integrity and Ethics
- Empathy and Compassion

## How I work :dancers:

While I may not be the most social person, I value deep connections with a select few individuals. I believe in the power of meaningful conversations and quality interactions over superficial small talk. Don't be surprised if I prefer one-on-one settings or quieter environments where I can truly engage and connect with others on a more personal level.
