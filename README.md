## Steven Atoche - @Sterben2530

Hi, I'm Steven - a dedicated student enrolled in the Economics program at PUCP. As I eagerly anticipates entering the job market next year, I am determined to secure a rewarding position where I can contribute meaningfully and make a difference.

##  Lenguajes de programaci√≥n

I have a strong command of Python, using it for various automation and data analysis tasks. I take advantage of Python's extensive libraries and frameworks to extract, clean, and analyze data, as well as create machine learning models and visualizations. In addition to Python, I am proficient in R, using it for statistical computing and data analysis. I also know how to use EViews, I use EViews to explore time series data, estimate econometric models, and evaluate economic relationships. With a comprehensive understanding of Python, R, and EViews, I am well-equipped to tackle various analytical challenges, employing the most appropriate tools and techniques for each project's requirements.

## My values :fire:

- Social Responsibility
- Resilience and Perseverance
- Integrity and Ethics
- Empathy and Compassion

## How I work :dancers:

While I may not be the most social person, I value deep connections with a select few individuals. I believe in the power of meaningful conversations and quality interactions over superficial small talk. Don't be surprised if I prefer one-on-one settings or quieter environments where I can truly engage and connect with others on a more personal level.
